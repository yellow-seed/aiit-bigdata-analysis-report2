SummarySo , in all , the network was accomplishing binary addition by : Converting the binary inputs into \" analog \" using a version of a digital to audio converter implemented using the weights of the input layerMapping that internal analog signal into periodic sine wave - like signals using the Ameo activation function ( even though that activation function is n't periodic)Saturating the sine wave - like signal to make it more like a square wave so outputs are as close as possible to the expected values of -1 and 1 for all outputsAs I mentioned , before , I had imagined the network learning some fancy combination of logic gates to perform the whole addition process digitally , similarly to how a binary adder operates .\n",

      "The next question is : how do we turn a code point like 64 ( 0x41 ) into the corresponding glyph image for the character A from a font , so we can blit it onto the screen?To make things easy for us , we 'll define some limits : We'll only render the printable Unicode code points between 0 - 255 as described above . Use a glyph rendering library like FreeType to load the font and render out a glyph image for each printable Unicode code point between 0 - 255.Pack those glyph images into a single image called the glyph atlas in some order which makes mapping from a code point to the glyph image coordinates inside the glyph atlas trivial . = STATE_OK ) break ; \t } while ( mfb_wait_sync(window ) ) ; \t return 0;}We start off by loading the font in line 11 , specifying the glyph atlas image path , the glyph width , and the glyph height .\n",

      "In the study led by the Institut Pasteur , published on January 13 in the journal Cell Genomics , the scientists analyzed the variability of the genomes of more than 2,800 individuals who lived in Europe over the past ten millennia – a period covering the Neolithic , the Bronze Age , the Iron Age , the Middle Ages and the present . By looking at the evolution of these mutations over time , they observed that those associated with an increased risk of inflammatory disorders – including Crohn 's disease – became more frequent over the past 10,000 years , while the frequency of those associated with a risk of developing infectious diseases decreased . \" These results suggest that the risk of inflammatory disorders has increased in Europeans since the Neolithic period because of a positive selection of mutations improving resistance to infectious diseases , \" explains Lluis Quintana - Murci , director of the study and Head of the Human Evolutionary Genetics Unit ( Institut Pasteur / CNRS Evolutionary Genomics , Modeling and Health Unit / Université Paris Cité).The results of the study , which harnessed the huge potential of paleogenomics , show that natural selection has targeted human immunity genes over the past ten millennia in Europe , especially since the start of the Bronze Age , and contributed to present - day disparities in terms of the risk of infectious and inflammatory diseases .\n",

We share the same goal : full source bootstrap for RISC - V.Tiny C   Compilers?There are many small C compilers out there that are written in simple C and areable to compile an old GCC that is written in C. Our favorite is TinyCC ( Tiny C   Compiler).GNU Mes is able to build a patched version of TinyCC , which already supportsRISC - V ( RV64 only ) , and we can use that TinyCC to compile the GCC version I ’m   backporting .

Second , the minimum possible is , in my opinion , that which isneeded to write : recursive descent parsing , so that they can parse existinglanguages which lack an unambiguous grammar ; and LR parsing so that they don'tkeep designing hard - to - parse languages in the future .\n",

      "What is so amazing about elliptic curves is that we can define an operation ( let ’s denote it ⊕ ) between rational points on them ( that is , both the x and y coordinates are rational numbers ) such that the set of those points on the curve becomes an Abelian group with respect to the operation ⊕ and with identity element 𝒪 ( the point at infinity).Let ’s define the operation . An important invariant that in some sense is the most defining feature is what is known as the rank of the curve ( or group).A curve can have a finite or an infinite number of rational points on them . One of the most important and interesting problems in number theory is called the Birch and Swinnerton - Dyer Conjecture and it is all about the rank of elliptic curves .\n",

Let 's hear it from the docs : The data types smallserial , serial and bigserial are not true types , but merely a notational convenience for creating unique identifier columns ( similar to the AUTO_INCREMENT property supported by some other databases).Using a serial column to create the users table would look like this : CREATE TABLE users (   i d serial PRIMARY KEY ,   email citext NOT NULL CHECK ( LENGTH(email ) < 255 ) ,   name text NOT NULL);OK , now let 's try inserting into it - we should n't have to specify id : INSERT INTO users_serial ( email , name ) VALUES ( ' user@example.com ' , ' new user');SELECT * FROM users;idemailname1user@example.comnew user(1 row ) INSERT 0 1It works , as you might expect - now the application does n't have to somehow magically know the right ID to use when inserting .

      "The new device started life as Sputnik , crammed into PIC-1000 shells painted pink with the same hideous screen , then into the purple Apollo prototype , and finally the finished product and the last publicly released Magic Cap device , the DataRover 840 announced in December 1997 running Magic Cap 3.1.The DataRover 840 was the only Magic Cap device to bear the General Magic name explicitly , though with a new logo . The unit in the case is my 2004 original and its backlight went out completely long ago , while the other used unit 's backlight is down to about 60 % . A U.S. Air Force technical report ( PDF ) on handheld computing devices for remote access summarized the DataRover as \" limited for use in [ handheld computing devices ] within tight vertical markets in that it has very little third party support , \" and further observed that \" Magic Cap , which had been thought of [ sic ] one of the best [ handheld computing device ] operating systems , has almost disappeared from the market . \"\n",

      "Superellipses are quite useful in design and UI work , especially a specific superellipse we ’ve come to know affectionately as the “ squircle ” . We just get an ellipse ( or a circle if the height and width are equal).When we go from 2 down to 1 , we see the straight edges turn to corners , and the corners become more straight . Fortunately , the Wikipedia page on superformulas gives us this nice chart as a starting point : The numbers on top of each image are the parameters m ( what we call symmetry ) , n1 , n2 and n3.So we can immediately see that the symmetry parameter controls how many “ nodes ” will be in the shape .\n",

      "It 's important to keep the two levels straight : the machine instruction is doing a conditional jump to a different memory address , while the microcode that implements this instruction is performing a conditional jump to a different micro - address . This circuitry evaluates each condition by getting the instruction bits from the Instruction Register , checking the bits to match each condition , and testing if the condition is satisfied . For instance , the overflow condition ( with instruction bits 000x ) is computed by a NOR gate : NOR(IR3 , IR2 , IR1 , OF ' ) , which will be true if instruction register bits 3 , 2 , and 1 are zero and the Overflow Flag is 1.The results from the individual condition tests are combined with a 7 - input NOR gate , producing a result that is 0 if the specified 3 - bit condition is satisfied .\n",

      "Turning Waves into CirclesBecause we can decompose signals into component sine waves , and convert sine waves into circles , we can convert every component sine wave of a signal into circles , and represent the signal as a sum of circles , where the y axis is the original signal , and the x axis is the signal with every component sine wave phase shifted by 90˚.component frequencies of a square wavesuccessively adding frequency components to form a square waveNotice how the component frequencies of this sawtooth wave trace out a U shape . Saturation corresponds to amount of noise , where : more noise → more white , less noise → purer colors . Interpreting ω as frequency , we can use the above formula to convert it to something corresponding to pitch ( class ) , and use the result as the hue of the color at this point .\n",

Although most of the celery on his table had been consumed , leaving only undesirable leftovers — stalks that were “ thin and small and without scarcely any leaves , mere tufts being suffered to remain ” — their images appeared in frost as the “ most vividly depicted stalks of celery with sprigs and leaves ” , proof that “ no other plant [ is ] endowed with such an extraordinary powerful vitality ” .\n",

This model is at odds with how the language work . It would be significantly more efficient to merge compiler and linker , such that only the minimal amount of code is compiled , compiled code is fully aware about surrounding context and can be inlined across crates , and where the compilation makes the optimal use of all available CPU and RAM.intra - crate parallelismC compilation model is not stupid — it is the way it is to enable separate compilation .\n",

      "Apple : The Only Big Tech Giant Going Against the Job Cuts TideOriginally published 26 January 2023 . Microsoft let go about 6 % of staff – 5,000 people . Apple has had the lowest headcount growth across the group of companies since 2018.In analyzing why Google did its historic job cuts I previously pointed to the connection that both Microsoft and Google laid people off after employee headcount growth raced ahead of revenue growth .\n",

      "Goals   implement a CPU in a hardware description language ( HDL),code must be synthesizable ( except memory),simulate it , and run a bare metal C program on it . A simple CPU consists of the following components : Arithmetic Logic Unit ( ALU ): the compute part , for operations like “ add ” or “ xor”Register File : provides and stores register valuesDecoder : transform instruction to a set of control signals , controlling the CPU operationProgram Counter : manages the address where the next instruction is foundLoad Store Unit ( LSU ): connects the CPU to its memoryControl Unit : tieing all the parts together to form a CPUThese are the basic elements of a CPU and sufficient for my toy RISC - V implementation . I hope to find time in the future to again work on this , finally run game of life on my CPU and actually run it in an FPGA .\n",

      "Georgia Institute of Technology     grid storagepower densityflow batteriesBy replacing the traditionally flat electrodes and membranes in a flow battery cell with wire electrodes and tubular membranes , researchers have shrunk the battery cell size by 75 percent . Unlike lithium - ion batteries , which store energy in solid electrodes , flow batteries store chemical energy in liquid electrolytes that sit in tanks . The distance between the electrodes and membranes goes down from the few millimeters common in a planar cell to less than a millimeter in this design , boosting power density .\n",

      "In my previous post about this setup , I mentioned that the T430 suffered unexpected shutdowns under certain situations , which usually involved running the fan at the lowest speed , moderate to high CPU load , and a lot of storage activity . There is also an option in UEFI settings that can be used to turn the laptop on by connecting the charger(“Power on with AC attach ” ) , but that only seems to work if you have a battery connected and after you have turned thelaptop on manually once . The fan only kicks in after the CPU reaches 60 ° C , ramps up to a moderate speed at over 85 ° C , and lets the default fanbehaviour handle everything if the temperatures reaches over 95 ° C . This results in the fan being off completely for mostof the day as the server is idling at around 5 - 10 % CPU usage and temperatures being anywhere between 45 - 60 ° C . When thereis a workload on the system that taxes the CPU , the fan will kick on with a small delay .\n",

      "Now that we know that the force of buoyancy depends on the submerged volume we can also analyze what happens when the wooden block is forcefully tilted : The local forces exerted by pressure are no longer symmetrical so they end up having an uneven effect on the body . The weight of water it can displace is larger than the weight of the ship itself causing gravity and buoyancy to balance each other . For top performance the blade ’s direction should stay within the green region : A propeller will work most efficiently if the velocity of a blade relative to water is in that angular range .\n",
